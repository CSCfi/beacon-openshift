## Luigi Process Dump

This directory serves as a tracker for the luigi workflow. It is populated with "task-completed" files by the workflow. Consider pruning the directory after each run. Read more about luigi's operating principle from the [documentation](https://luigi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tasks.html).
